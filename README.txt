I'm trying to build an Android app using Python, Kivy, and KivyMD, but depending on how the buildozer.spec and yaml files are configured, errors often occur during the build process, causing it to stop.
After many trials and errors, I found a method that works properly.
I'm going to share that.
Would you like to share your working configuration? 
I'd be interested in learning about the specific settings that helped you resolve the build issues.

By the way, it is work with ubuntu 22-04. So If you want to with unbuntu 24-04, first 22-04, and change a number in build_action.yml "runs-on: ubuntu-24.04"

Good Luck!!
