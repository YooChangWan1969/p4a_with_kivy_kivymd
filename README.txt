I'm trying to build an Android app using Python, Kivy, and KivyMD, but depending on how the buildozer.spec and yaml files are configured, errors often occur during the build process, causing it to stop.
After many trials and errors, I found a method that works properly.

I'd be interested in learning about the specific settings that helped you resolve the build issues.

By the way, it is work with ubuntu 22-04. 
So If you want to with unbuntu 24-04, first of all, BUILD FIRST UBUNTU 22-04, and SECOND, CHANGE A NUMBER in build_action.yml "runs-on: ubuntu-24.04" like a build_action_second.yml

Good Luck!!

P.S.
Buildozer is not available on Ubuntu 24.4 or later. 
So Two step required
